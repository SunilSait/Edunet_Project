## Problem Statement
The project involves a movie dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. The goal is to predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification or deep learning algorithms.

## Proposed Solution
### Objective:
Develop a binary sentiment classification model that accurately predicts whether a given movie review is positive or negative.

### Dataset:
A large dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews, with an equal distribution of 25,000 highly polar reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. The reviews are already labeled as either positive or negative.

### Tasks:
#### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
- Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, stemming/lemmatization, and converting text data into numerical representations (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).

#### Model Development:
- Develop a binary classification model using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest.
- Alternatively, implement deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Transformers for sentiment analysis.

#### Model Training:
- Train the model using the training dataset (25,000 reviews).
- Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.

#### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset (25,000 reviews) using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

#### Prediction:
- Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of unseen movie reviews, classifying them as either positive or negative.

## System Approach
The "System Approach" section outlines the overall strategy and methodology for developing and implementing the movie review prediction system.

### System requirements:
- **User Input:** Users should be able to input movie reviews through a web interface.
- **Sentiment Prediction:** The system should process the input and predict whether the review is positive or negative.
- **Real-Time Response:** The system should provide real-time predictions.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to provide feedback on the accuracy of the predictions for future improvements.

### Library required to build the model:
- Python programming language
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, NLTK, and Flask (for deployment)

## Algorithm & Deployment
### Algorithm Chosen:
Binary Classification using IBM Watson Studio AI.

### Data Input:
- Preprocessed Movie Review Text
- Extracted Features: N-grams and TF-IDF values and Sentiment Scores from Lexicons

### Training Process:
- The model was trained using the IBM Watson Studio AI platform.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were employed to optimize the model's performance.

### Prediction Process:
- The trained model was deployed on IBM Cloud, leveraging IBM Watson Studio AI's capabilities for efficient handling and processing of Movie Reviews.
- The deployment ensures real-time sentiment analysis, allowing the model to classify Movie Reviews into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative) with high confidence.

## Result
The machine learning model successfully predicted the sentiment of Movie Reviews with high confidence.

### Prediction Type:
Binary Sentiment Classification 

### Prediction Percentage:
Based on 123 records, the sentiments are split between 37% negative (neg) and 63% positive (pos) sentiments.

## Conclusion
- **Model Performance:** Evaluate the model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to understand the effectiveness of the sentiment classification model.
- **Review Distribution:** The final output provides the number of positive and negative reviews predicted by the model.
- **Further Improvements:** If the model performance is not satisfactory, consider using more advanced techniques like deep learning models (LSTM, CNN) and tuning hyperparameters for better results.

## Future Scope
- **Advanced Models:** Implement state-of-the-art transformer-based models like BERT and GPT for better accuracy.
- **Data Augmentation:** Use techniques like SMOTE and back-translation to generate more training data.
- **User Feedback:** Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the model.
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combine text and video analysis for comprehensive sentiment analysis.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Ensure fairness and address ethical issues in sentiment analysis.
